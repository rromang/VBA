# VBA for Data Processing and Analysis
(VBA-Challenge)
Repository for Data BootCamp VBA Homework

Data for worksheet was provided.

All modules I used while developing the code are included as well as the unified script called "process_data". This script is meant to run all the different pieces of code as one single script.

Modules and scripts were used to remove duplicates, handle multiple tabs, calculate percent change, total volume per stock type, color code for positive or negative change and to summarize the highest and lowest changes.
